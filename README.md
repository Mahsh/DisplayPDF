This repository instructs you how to display your pdf file in github.

All the things can be done with the help of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

#### Upload your pdf files
Upload your pdf files to the github repository in your convinient way. For example, I upload a test.pdf to "Mahsh/DisplayPDF" repository. In order to display the pdf files in your browser, make sure upload your files with "master" or "gh-pages" branch.
