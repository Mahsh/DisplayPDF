# DisplayPDF

This repository instructs you how to display your pdf file in github. [Like this](https://mahsh.github.io/DisplayPDF/test.pdf)

All the things can be done with the help of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

What you need to do includes:
- Upload your pdf files to the repo;
- Edit the settings of the repo;
- Share the links of your files.

#### Upload your pdf files
Upload your pdf files to the github repository in your convinient way. For example, I upload a test.pdf to "Mahsh/DisplayPDF" repository. In order to display the pdf files in your browser, make sure upload your files with "master" or "gh-pages" branch.
#### Edit the settings
Edit the settings of your repository. For the "GitHub Pages" term, select the source with "master branch" or "gh-pages branch" then save.
#### Share the links
The link of your file in the form of "https:// YourAccountName.github.io/ +RepoName+FileName ". For instance, the "test.pdf" that I uploaded in the first step has the link "https://mahsh.github.io/DisplayPDF/test.pdf".

Enjoy it!
